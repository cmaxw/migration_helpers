MigrationHelpers
================

This migration helper is intended to make migrations easier and allow the user to add data integrity at the
database level. This currently only includes foreign keys.

TODO: Add a :unique => true availability to the add_column method to create the unique index
TODO: Make the script/generate script add foreign keys to column:references columns

Example
=======

Let's assume you have two tables.

Table 'users' has fields id, name, address, phone, zip, role_id
Table 'roles' has fields id, name

In the up migration you can create a foreign key:

add_foreign_key :users, :role_id, :roles

In the down migration you can drop a foreign key:

drop_foreign_key :users, :role_id


If you do not wish to use the id column in the referenced table, you may specify the column
with a forth parameter on add_foreign_key. A fifth parameter is a custom constraint name.
